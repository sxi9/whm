# Cross-category contracts for the wave-1 fix round

These decisions resolve the seams the integration critic found. Every fixer must follow them;
they are authoritative over anything a builder did earlier.

## 1. Service names on ctx (authoritative)
`ctx.security` (security-center), `ctx.dns` (dns-functions), `ctx.databases` (database-services —
never `ctx.db`, which is the SQLite handle, and never `ctx.db_services`), `ctx.ip` (ip-functions),
`ctx.ssl` (ssl-tls), `ctx.mail` (email), `ctx.software` (software) **plus the alias
`ctx.pkg = ctx.software.pkg`** set by software's register(), `ctx.web` (service-configuration),
`ctx.development`, `ctx.locales`. Consumers reference them lazily inside methods and tolerate absence.

## 2. "Configure Remote Service IPs" hooks (ip-functions is the caller)
ip-functions calls, when present: `ctx.mail.setOutboundAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`,
`ctx.dns.setOutboundAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`, `ctx.databases.setClientAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`.
- email implements `setOutboundAddresses` (Exim: `interface = <ipv4> ; <ipv6>` for the remote_smtp
  transport in the managed macro/include, validated with `exim -bV`, reload).
- dns-functions implements `setOutboundAddresses` (BIND options `query-source address <ipv4>;`,
  `query-source-v6 address <ipv6>;`, `notify-source`/`transfer-source` in the managed include,
  `named-checkconf`, reload).
- database-services implements `setClientAddresses` (MySQL client `[client] bind-address` in the
  credentials/defaults file used for remote profiles; recorded in settings).
Each returns `{ applied: true }` or throws CapabilityError when the daemon is missing. ip-functions
records per-service outcome and never fails the whole request because one hook is absent.

## 3. Dovecot drop-ins
service-configuration owns `97-whm-mailserver.conf` (protocols, limits, `ssl = …`,
`ssl_min_protocol`, `ssl_cipher_list`, `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers`).
ssl-tls writes ONLY `ssl_cert = </path` and `ssl_key = </path` (and `ssl_ca` when a chain exists) into
`90-whm-ssl-cert.conf` — nothing else — and removes any other directive from its drop-in.
TLS protocol/cipher presets for Dovecot and Exim chosen in "SSL/TLS Configuration" are applied by
calling `ctx.web.applyMailserverTls({ minProtocol, cipherList })` and `ctx.web.applyEximTls({ … })`,
which service-configuration implements (stores in its settings, re-renders its files, validates,
reloads). ssl-tls keeps ownership of the Apache SSL protocol/cipher include.

## 4. Exim local RCPT ACL chain (Debian split config and RHEL)
service-configuration owns the single hook point: on Debian the macro
`CHECK_RCPT_LOCAL_ACL_FILE` → `/etc/exim4/whm/acl-rcpt-local.conf`; on RHEL an equivalent include in
the managed block of `/etc/exim/exim.conf`. That ACL file is rendered by service-configuration (its
dictionary-attack / rate / RBL protections) and ENDS with
`.include_if_exists /etc/exim4/whm/acl-email-filters.conf` (Debian) or
`/etc/exim/whm/acl-email-filters.conf` (RHEL).
email writes ONLY `acl-email-filters.conf` (country/domain/greylist rules) and never the macro.
service-configuration exposes `ctx.web.ensureEximAclChain()` which creates the macro + chain file if
"Exim Configuration Manager" has never been saved; email calls it (when `ctx.web` exists) before
writing its file. Fallback when `ctx.web` is absent: email may set the macro itself (current code).

## 5. Exim layout detection (shared)
Put the Debian/RHEL Exim layout detection in a new helper module `agent/src/ops/exim-layout.js`
(pure functions, defines no ops; the loader imports it harmlessly) and use it from BOTH `mail.js`
and `web.js`. It must read `dc_use_split_config` from `/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf`: when
`'true'` use `conf.d/` fragments; when `'false'` (Debian default) write macros to
`/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros` and ACL hooks through the macros, then run
`update-exim4.conf` and validate with `exim -bV`. Never flip the operator's split-config setting.

## 6. Migrations
Never edit a migration that may already have been applied. Add a new file instead (e.g.
`002b_security-center-firewall.sql`) using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `INSERT OR IGNORE`; it is
fine for the original file to also contain the objects as long as both are idempotent.

## 7. Agent errors → HTTP
The core error handler now maps agent error codes: `capability_missing`/`binary_not_found` → 501,
`invalid_args` → 422, `not_found` → 404, `exists` → 409, and **any code starting with `invalid_`,
ending with `_mismatch`, or in {`config_invalid`, `refused`, `validation_failed`, `acme_failed`,
`unsupported`, `in_use`}** → 422 with the op's message. Services may let such AgentErrors propagate
instead of wrapping them; still wrap when a friendlier message is needed.

## 8. Write-after-apply ordering
Any mutation that changes the host must run the agent op FIRST and commit the SQLite change only
after it succeeds (or run both inside a try with compensation). A record must never say "applied"
when the host was not changed.

## 9. Scheduled jobs
A schedule must not enqueue persistent `jobs` rows for work that will be skipped. Toggle the
schedule's `enabled` flag (via `ctx.scheduler.update(name, { enabled })`) when the feature is
enabled/disabled, or check the precondition inside the scheduler-facing wrapper before enqueueing.
