# Cross-category contracts for the wave-1 fix round

These decisions resolve the seams the integration critic found. Every fixer must follow them;
they are authoritative over anything a builder did earlier.

## 1. Service names on ctx (authoritative)
`ctx.security` (security-center), `ctx.dns` (dns-functions), `ctx.databases` (database-services —
never `ctx.db`, which is the SQLite handle, and never `ctx.db_services`), `ctx.ip` (ip-functions),
`ctx.ssl` (ssl-tls), `ctx.mail` (email), `ctx.software` (software) **plus the alias
`ctx.pkg = ctx.software.pkg`** set by software's register(), `ctx.web` (service-configuration),
`ctx.development`, `ctx.locales`. Consumers reference them lazily inside methods and tolerate absence.

## 2. "Configure Remote Service IPs" hooks (ip-functions is the caller)
ip-functions calls, when present: `ctx.mail.setOutboundAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`,
`ctx.dns.setOutboundAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`, `ctx.databases.setClientAddresses({ ipv4, ipv6 })`.
- email implements `setOutboundAddresses` (Exim: `interface = <ipv4> ; <ipv6>` for the remote_smtp
  transport in the managed macro/include, validated with `exim -bV`, reload).
- dns-functions implements `setOutboundAddresses` (BIND options `query-source address <ipv4>;`,
  `query-source-v6 address <ipv6>;`, `notify-source`/`transfer-source` in the managed include,
  `named-checkconf`, reload).
- database-services implements `setClientAddresses` (MySQL client `[client] bind-address` in the
  credentials/defaults file used for remote profiles; recorded in settings).
Each returns `{ applied: true }` or throws CapabilityError when the daemon is missing. ip-functions
records per-service outcome and never fails the whole request because one hook is absent.

## 3. Dovecot drop-ins
service-configuration owns `97-whm-mailserver.conf` (protocols, limits, `ssl = …`,
`ssl_min_protocol`, `ssl_cipher_list`, `ssl_prefer_server_ciphers`).
ssl-tls writes ONLY `ssl_cert = </path` and `ssl_key = </path` (and `ssl_ca` when a chain exists) into
`90-whm-ssl-cert.conf` — nothing else — and removes any other directive from its drop-in.
TLS protocol/cipher presets for Dovecot and Exim chosen in "SSL/TLS Configuration" are applied by
calling `ctx.web.applyMailserverTls({ minProtocol, cipherList })` and `ctx.web.applyEximTls({ … })`,
which service-configuration implements (stores in its settings, re-renders its files, validates,
reloads). ssl-tls keeps ownership of the Apache SSL protocol/cipher include.

## 4. Exim local RCPT ACL chain (Debian split config and RHEL)
service-configuration owns the single hook point: on Debian the macro
`CHECK_RCPT_LOCAL_ACL_FILE` → `/etc/exim4/whm/acl-rcpt-local.conf`; on RHEL an equivalent include in
the managed block of `/etc/exim/exim.conf`. That ACL file is rendered by service-configuration (its
dictionary-attack / rate / RBL protections) and ENDS with
`.include_if_exists /etc/exim4/whm/acl-email-filters.conf` (Debian) or
`/etc/exim/whm/acl-email-filters.conf` (RHEL).
email writes ONLY `acl-email-filters.conf` (country/domain/greylist rules) and never the macro.
service-configuration exposes `ctx.web.ensureEximAclChain()` which creates the macro + chain file if
"Exim Configuration Manager" has never been saved; email calls it (when `ctx.web` exists) before
writing its file. Fallback when `ctx.web` is absent: email may set the macro itself (current code).

## 5. Exim layout detection (shared)
Put the Debian/RHEL Exim layout detection in a new helper module `agent/src/ops/exim-layout.js`
(pure functions, defines no ops; the loader imports it harmlessly) and use it from BOTH `mail.js`
and `web.js`. It must read `dc_use_split_config` from `/etc/exim4/update-exim4.conf.conf`: when
`'true'` use `conf.d/` fragments; when `'false'` (Debian default) write macros to
`/etc/exim4/exim4.conf.localmacros` and ACL hooks through the macros, then run
`update-exim4.conf` and validate with `exim -bV`. Never flip the operator's split-config setting.

## 6. Migrations
Never edit a migration that may already have been applied. Add a new file instead (e.g.
`002b_security-center-firewall.sql`) using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `INSERT OR IGNORE`; it is
fine for the original file to also contain the objects as long as both are idempotent.

## 7. Agent errors → HTTP
The core error handler now maps agent error codes: `capability_missing`/`binary_not_found` → 501,
`invalid_args` → 422, `not_found` → 404, `exists` → 409, and **any code starting with `invalid_`,
ending with `_mismatch`, or in {`config_invalid`, `refused`, `validation_failed`, `acme_failed`,
`unsupported`, `in_use`}** → 422 with the op's message. Services may let such AgentErrors propagate
instead of wrapping them; still wrap when a friendlier message is needed.

## 8. Write-after-apply ordering
Any mutation that changes the host must run the agent op FIRST and commit the SQLite change only
after it succeeds (or run both inside a try with compensation). A record must never say "applied"
when the host was not changed.

## 9. Scheduled jobs
A schedule must not enqueue persistent `jobs` rows for work that will be skipped. Toggle the
schedule's `enabled` flag (via `ctx.scheduler.update(name, { enabled })`) when the feature is
enabled/disabled, or check the precondition inside the scheduler-facing wrapper before enqueueing.

## 10. Reseller ACLs, limits and nameservers (resellers is the owner)
`ctx.resellers` (tolerate absence: every call below is `ctx.resellers?.<fn>?.(…)`) exposes:
- `hasAcl(user, key)` / `assertAcl(user, key)` — root is always allowed; a reseller whose ACLs were
  never saved (no `reseller_acls` rows) keeps ownership-only access; once saved, every key is stored
  with value 0/1 and an empty selection denies everything (`'all'` grants every key).
- `createPolicy(user, { pkgName, plan, ip })` and `modifyPolicy(user, account, { pkgName, diskQuotaMb,
  bandwidthLimitMb, ip })` — limits, allowed/global packages and IP delegation. Core `accounts.create`
  and `accounts.modify` call them; any category that creates or re-plans accounts by another path must too.
- `nameserversFor(ownerId)` → `string[]` (empty = server defaults). Core `accounts.create` passes it as
  `ctx.dns.ensureZoneForDomain(domain, { ip, accountId, nameservers })`. **dns-functions must consume
  `nameservers` (ns1/ns2 for the SOA/NS template) and fall back to `basic.nameservers` when absent**;
  until it does, zones for reseller-owned accounts advertise the server defaults and "Edit Reseller
  Nameservers and Privileges" counts as partial (resellers' test `passes the reseller's nameservers to
  DNS Functions` pins the call shape; `owns_nameservers` stays informational either way).
- `sharedIpFor(user)`, `delegatedAddresses(userId)` — the only addresses a reseller may assign.

ACL keys enforced by core (`services/accounts.js`): `create-acct`, `suspend-acct` (suspend/unsuspend),
`kill-acct` (terminate), `passwd`, `edit-account` (any modify), `upgrade-account` (package change),
`quota`, `limit-bandwidth`, `add-pkg-ip` (IP change), `viewglobalpackages`, `allow-unlimited-disk-pkgs`,
`allow-unlimited-bw-pkgs`. Keys each category must check on its own reseller-reachable routes
(`ctx.resellers?.assertAcl?.(req.user, key)` in the service): packages `add-pkg` (create/delete),
`edit-pkg`; account-functions/multi-account `rearrange-accts`, `demo-setup`, `add-pkg-shell`,
`show-bandwidth`, `acct-summary`, `list-accts`; dns-functions `add-dns`, `edit-dns`, `kill-dns`,
`clustering`; email `edit-mx`, `mailcheck`, `mail-queue`; ssl-tls `ssl`, `ssl-info`, `ssl-gencrt`,
`ssl-buy`; server-status/service-manager `status`, `stats`, `restart`; locales `locale-edit`;
development/API tokens `cpanel-api`, `thirdparty`; security `digest-auth`, `mysql-superuser`,
`disallow-shell`; server-contacts/news `news`. Until a category wires its key, that key is stored
but not enforced.

# Wave-2 contracts (binding; added after the wave-2 build)

## 11. Service names on ctx (authoritative, wave 2)
`ctx.accountFunctions` (account-functions), `ctx.accountInfo` (account-information),
`ctx.multiAccount` (multi-account-functions), `ctx.resellers`, `ctx.backup`, `ctx.transfers`,
`ctx.serverStatus` (server-status), `ctx.systemHealth` (system-health), `ctx.serverConfig`
(server-configuration), `ctx.networking` (networking-setup), `ctx.contacts` (server-contacts),
`ctx.systemReboot` (system-reboot). Hooks core relies on and that MUST keep their names/signatures:
`ctx.resellers.assertAcl/createPolicy/modifyPolicy/nameserversFor`,
`ctx.accountFunctions.mountpointFor/renderTemplate/runBandwidthEnforce/resetBandwidth`,
`ctx.serverConfig.profile.summary()`, `ctx.contacts.notify(event, payload)` and
`ctx.contacts.sendMail({ to, subject, text })`. Reference other services lazily inside methods and
tolerate absence (optional chaining).

## 12. Bandwidth: one owner per concern
- **account-information owns collection and the `account_bandwidth` table** (job
  `account_info.bandwidth_collect`). Its collect job MUST NOT call enforcement.
- **account-functions owns enforcement and reset**: the toggle, the schedule
  `account-bandwidth-enforce` (the only enforcement schedule) and `resetBandwidth`. To clear the
  current period it calls `ctx.accountInfo.resetPeriod(usernames)` (account-information adds this
  method; it deletes/zeroes the current period rows of its own table) and falls back to zeroing
  `accounts.bandwidth_used_mb` when the method is absent.
- `ctx.accountInfo.resetBandwidth` delegates to `ctx.accountFunctions.resetBandwidth` when present.
- account-information's domlog listing uses the op maximum (`limit: 10000`) and logs a warning
  through the job when a directory hits the cap; never silently under-count.

## 13. Update checks: software owns the schedule
software's `os-update-check` schedule (job `software.update.check`) is the single scheduled check.
server-configuration removes its `update-preferences-check` schedule (do not enqueue it; drop the
`scheduler.ensure` call and delete the row in a new `020b_` migration), reads "last check" from
software's settings through `ctx.software.update.status()`, and its "Check now" button calls
`ctx.software.update.check()`. Update Preferences keeps owning the release channel / auto-update
preference settings and passes them to software through `ctx.software.panel.setPreferences(...)` if
that method exists, otherwise stores them under `updates.*` for software to read.

## 14. Vhost results and IP changes (service-configuration is the owner of the semantics)
`ctx.web.ensureVhost` may return `{ applied: false, reason: 'php_missing' | 'php_pool_failed', … }`
AFTER the vhost files were written and Apache reloaded; that is a PHP-handler warning, not a vhost
failure. Consumers changing an address MUST call `ctx.web.replaceIp(previousIp, newIp, { accounts:
[username] }, req)` (rewrites only the address; reports `updated`) instead of `ensureVhost`, and
treat `reason in { php_missing, php_pool_failed }` as applied-with-warning anywhere `ensureVhost` is
still used. Applies to multi-account-functions (Change Multiple Sites' IP Addresses) and
account-functions (Change Site's IP Address).

## 15. Long agent calls in split mode
`lib/agent-client.js` times out socket calls after 1 h unless `{ timeoutMs }` is passed. Every
service that calls an op declared with a longer agent-side `timeoutMs` (backup archive/restore/
import/upload/download; transfers rsync/extract/stream) passes `{ req, timeoutMs: <op timeout> +
60_000 }` from its `op()` helper (a LONG_OPS map keyed by op name).

## 16. Untrusted content is never recreated as root with special files
transfers: rsync uses `-rlpt` (never `-D`, `--devices`, `--specials`); archives are listed with
`tar -tvf` first and any member of type `b`/`c` (device) or with an absolute/`..` path is refused
with `invalid_archive` before extraction; agent tests cover both. backup's own archives are
produced by the panel, but `backup.files.restore` applies the same member filter.

## 17. Restores never widen privileges
backup: database-user grants from an archive are replayed only for databases that
`databaseClaim()` accepted for this account (reuse `parseGrant`/ownership); global (`*.*`) and
system-schema grants (mysql, information_schema, performance_schema, sys) are dropped. The agent
op `backup.db.restore_users` rejects `ON *.*` and system-schema grants itself (defence in depth)
and takes an `allowedDatabases` list. Restoring a terminated account re-adds every parked/addon/
sub domain from `metadata.domains` (insert `account_domains` rows and provision the vhost via
`ctx.web.ensureVhost`; record per-domain outcomes in `summary.steps.domains`).

## 18. Reseller-safe operations
transfers: "Move databases to the new account" is root-only because `ctx.databases.assign` is
root-only — the preview reports an `issue` for non-root callers and the page hides the toggle for
resellers; the reseller test covers it. `removeSource` on Convert Addon Domain is refused (issue,
re-checked before `fs.remove`) when the docroot equals the account's `home_dir` or
`<home_dir>/public_html`, or contains/equals another domain's docroot of that account.

## 19. Moving a live account (Rearrange an Account)
account-functions: lock the Linux user (`user.lock`) and record a `rearrange` suspension before the
first copy; unlock at the end. Remove the old tree ONLY when `acct.set_home` and the vhost rewrite
both succeeded; otherwise keep both trees, record the state in the job and tell the operator. On an
exception after the copy, remove the partial target tree and restore the previous home. Test: old
home kept when `ctx.web.ensureVhost` throws.

## 20. Migrations
`012` is used by both `012_account-functions.sql` and `012_development-token-expiry.sql` (a
documented exception; both apply in filename order). Never reuse a number: wave-2 categories own
013–023 as assigned; follow-ups are `0NNb_<slug>-<topic>.sql`, idempotent, never editing a
committed file.

## 21. Schedules and settings toggles
Where a feature has an enable/disable setting (process-log sampler, system-health BPK, bandwidth
enforcement), the setting is the single source of truth and the schedule row follows it; the
generic schedules endpoint (Configure cPanel Cron Jobs) may change cron/enabled too, so
`alignSchedule`/`syncSchedule` helpers must only write the row when the setting changed (compare
before writing), never on every page load.
